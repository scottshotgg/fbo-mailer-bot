List of actions when starting up:

	1) Connect to the database
	2) Make sure the database is setup (all the tables, counters, junk, etc)
	3) Load the entire database into memory, w/e better than going to disk everytime and memory is cheap
	4) Schedule scrapings
	5) Start up the webserver (this may be able to be done at the same time as the database depending on what we need)
	6)
