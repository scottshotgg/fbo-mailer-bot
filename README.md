# fbo-mailer-bot

spider.js is the main file, it is the currently deployed program, but I am switching all development to the [rearch branch](https://www.github.com/scottshotgg/fbo-mailer-bot "FBO Mailer Bot: Re-architecture").

This branch uses Nightmare JS (headless web browser) to scrape their page, but as I figured out form submission (and made it too efficient) and then their FTP site, I decided to rearchitecture the program.

Use the rearch branch, it serves as the master now. I will switch them later, but the current master is the the currently deployed code and thus deserves the title master for now.
